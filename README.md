# Drop-seq-PjHem
These are commads for Drop-seq analyzing of hemocytes of kuruma shrimp (*Penaues japonicus*). The detailed scientific explanation is published under BioRxiv.  
Here, I uploaded commads used on this paper.

The data have been deposited with links to BioProject accession number PRJDBXXXXXXX in the DDBJ BioProject database.
